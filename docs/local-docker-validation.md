# Local Docker/Podman validation

This guide runs the local RBAC API validations against the full Kessel stack.
The commands use Podman when it is available, but Docker is also supported.

## Start the stack

Start the current checkout:

```bash
make docker-local-full-up local
```

Start an RBAC pull request in a temporary worktree:

```bash
make docker-local-full-up pr=https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-rbac/pull/3309
```

To use a local RBAC Config checkout, build its stage schema and attach it to
the local stack automatically:

```bash
make docker-local-full-up local \
  rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config
```

### Rebuild running RBAC services

When the full stack is already running, you can rebuild and restart only the
RBAC services without tearing down the entire stack. This is faster than a
full `docker-local-full-down` / `docker-local-full-up` cycle after code changes.

Rebuild only RBAC (server, worker, scheduler, Kafka consumer):

```bash
make docker-local-full-up local rebuild=rbac
```

This rebuilds the local RBAC Docker image from the current checkout, runs
migrations, and recreates the four RBAC services. Other services (SpiceDB,
Relations API, Kafka, HBI) are left untouched.

Rebuild RBAC together with a local `rbac-config` checkout:

```bash
make docker-local-full-up local rebuild=rbac,rbac-config \
  rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config
```

This additionally compiles the local stage KSL schema from `rbac-config`,
writes it into SpiceDB, refreshes Relations API, reseeds RBAC role
definitions, and recreates the RBAC services. Use this mode when both RBAC
code and KSL schema changes need to be tested together.

The rebuild modes require the `local` deployment source and a running stack.
If the stack is not running, start it first with `make docker-local-full-up local`.

### Deployment source combinations

The full-stack command can combine an RBAC checkout or pull request with an
RBAC Config checkout or pull request:

| RBAC source | RBAC Config source | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current local checkout | Default/stage config | `make docker-local-full-up local` |
| RBAC GitHub PR | Default/stage config | `make docker-local-full-up pr=https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-rbac/pull/3309` |
| Current local RBAC | RBAC Config PR | `make docker-local-full-up local rbac_config_pr=https://github.com/project-kessel/rbac-config/pull/789` |
| Current local RBAC | Current local `rbac-config` checkout | `make docker-local-full-up local rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config` |
| RBAC GitHub PR | RBAC Config PR | `make docker-local-full-up pr=<rbac-pr-url> rbac_config_pr=<rbac-config-pr-url>` |
| RBAC GitHub PR | Current local `rbac-config` checkout | `make docker-local-full-up pr=<rbac-pr-url> rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config` |
| Rebuild running RBAC only | N/A | `make docker-local-full-up local rebuild=rbac` |
| Rebuild running RBAC | Rebuild local `rbac-config` | `make docker-local-full-up local rebuild=rbac,rbac-config rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config` |

For local changes in both repositories:

```bash
make docker-local-full-up local \
  rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config
```

This automatically runs `make ksl-test-schema-stage` in `rbac-config`, loads
the generated schema into local SpiceDB, refreshes Relations API, runs
`rbac-migrate`, and restarts `rbac-server`, `rbac-worker`, `rbac-scheduler`,
and `rbac-kafka-consumer`.

When only `rbac-config` or its schema changes, rerun the same command. If RBAC
source code also changed, perform a full rebuild first:

```bash
make docker-local-full-down
make docker-local-full-up local \
  rbac_config_repo=/absolute/path/to/rbac-config
```

When a config or schema option is supplied and the stack is already running,
the command intentionally refreshes schema/config-related services without
rebuilding the RBAC or HBI images.

Wait until the RBAC API is available at `http://localhost:9080`.

## Run all validations

```bash
make docker-local-full-validate
```

The Make target discovers every `*.sh` file below `scripts/validations/` and
runs them in lexical order. The current local checks include:

- workspace creation and read-your-writes pipeline validation;
- V2 workspace, role, principal, and role-binding CRUD validation, including
  persisted Kessel relations and relation cleanup;
- read-only inspection of all RBAC organizations and their persisted users.

### Identity used by each validation

The scripts print the runtime identity they use. This is the complete local
mapping:

| Script/action | API/version | Organization and account | User | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api/v2-crud.sh` | V2 | `org_id=11111`, `account_id=10001` | Unique temporary `v2-crud-user-<timestamp>-<pid>`, `admin: true` | Created from a temporary YAML fixture and deleted on exit |
| `api/create-workspace-local.sh` | V2 | `org_id=11111`, `account_id=10001` by default | `user_dev`, user ID `51736777` by default | Uses the existing local seeded tenant/principal; override with `RYW_ORG_ID`, `RYW_ACCOUNT_ID`, `RYW_USERNAME`, and `RYW_USER_ID` |
| `api/actions/apply-rbac-users-config.sh` | V2 fixture loader | Values come from `actions/rbac-users.yaml` or `--file` | Values come from each YAML `users` entry | Persists users, groups, roles, and bindings until changed/deleted |
| `api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh` | No API mutation | Reads every tenant in the running RBAC database | Lists persisted principals; `generate-user` defaults to org `11111`, account `10001`, and a generated user ID | `list` is read-only; `generate-user` creates only a header |

`v2-crud.sh` is self-contained: it does not use `user_dev` or any pre-existing
user. Its temporary YAML fixture creates the principal, a temporary V2 access
role, and a tenant-level binding. The script sends that user in
`X-RH-Identity`, runs the V2 CRUD scenarios, removes API/Kessel test data, and
deletes the fixture user. `admin: true` is metadata; the V2 role binding is
what grants the write permissions.

`create-workspace-local.sh` exercises only V2 workspace creation and the
read-your-writes pipeline. It uses the existing local seeded V2 identity by
default and does not use the V1 API. If you override the identity, the tenant
and principal must already exist in the RBAC database.

## Run individual checks

Run the V2 API lifecycle check:

```bash
scripts/validations/api/v2-crud.sh
```

Run workspace creation and read-your-writes directly when the stack is already
running:

```bash
scripts/validations/api/create-workspace-local.sh --no-start
```

This check validates the V2 workspace RYW path. The full stack still starts
HBI and its Inventory API, but the current `test_ryw.py` helper does not assert
HBI replication; `--check-hbi` is therefore informational and prints a warning
instead of passing unsupported arguments to the helper.

List organizations and users/principals from the running RBAC container:

```bash
scripts/validations/api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh
```

The users action is read-only. It uses the container's Django ORM and prints
each organization, account, principal count, username, user ID, principal
type, and UUID. It also lists every V2 role with its permissions and every
role binding with its role, resource, and user/group subjects.

Generate an identity header for a new local test user without changing the
database:

```bash
scripts/validations/api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh generate-user --admin --v2
scripts/validations/api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh generate-user --non-admin --v1
```

The command prints the identity JSON, its base64 `X-RH-Identity` value, and a
ready-to-run `curl` example. Use `--org-id`, `--account-number`, `--username`,
or `--user-id` to override the generated values. This command is deliberately
header-only: it does not create a database user, bootstrap a tenant, or grant
Kessel permissions. The `--admin` flag only changes the identity header's
`is_org_admin` value.

To create real local users and bootstrap their tenant, use the declarative
fixture action:

```bash
scripts/validations/api/actions/apply-rbac-users-config.sh
scripts/validations/api/actions/apply-rbac-users-config.sh --dry-run
scripts/validations/api/actions/apply-rbac-users-config.sh \
  --file /absolute/path/to/rbac-users.yaml
```

For a validation-only fixture, mark the tenant `temporary: true`. The action
can then remove the declared custom roles and users through the normal RBAC
disable path:

```bash
scripts/validations/api/actions/apply-rbac-users-config.sh \
  --file /absolute/path/to/temporary-users.yaml --delete
```

Deletion is refused unless every tenant in the YAML is explicitly marked
temporary, so a normal persistent fixture cannot be removed accidentally.

The example fixture is
[`scripts/validations/api/actions/rbac-users.yaml`](../scripts/validations/api/actions/rbac-users.yaml).
It supports, per tenant:

- `bootstrap: true` to create the tenant and its default workspaces;
- `users` with a username, external user ID, admin metadata, and group membership;
- `groups` with members and group-level role bindings;
- V2 custom `roles` with application/resource/operation permissions; and
- role bindings for users or groups at the user, group, or tenant level.

Applying the same fixture again is safe for the same tenant, user IDs, role
names, and binding subjects. User creation goes through the normal RBAC
bootstrap service, so the persisted principals and their outbox/Kessel
relations are visible to the running API. Authorization still comes from role
bindings; `admin: true` is identity metadata and is not a substitute for a
binding.

To inspect the schema currently loaded in local SpiceDB:

```bash
./scripts/zed_local.sh schema
```

## Output and colors

The users action colors interactive terminal output automatically. Override it
when needed:

```bash
COLOR=always scripts/validations/api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh
COLOR=never scripts/validations/api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh
NO_COLOR=1 scripts/validations/api/actions/list-rbac-users.sh
```

## Stop the stack

```bash
make docker-local-full-down
```

This stops the local full stack and keeps its volumes.
