    Checks whether the user's Principal record already has a ``user_id`` set;
    if so, no sync is needed.  System users, service accounts, inactive users,
    and users without a ``user_id`` are skipped.

    Validates the user's org_id against the tenant and falls back to the
    tenant's org_id when the user has none.  A shallow copy is used when a
    fallback is needed so the caller's object is never mutated.

    Raises on failure — callers that want best-effort behaviour should catch
    exceptions themselves.

        bootstrap_service: TenantBootstrapService instance.
        user: User object to sync.
        tenant: Tenant instance for principal lookup.
